# Kaggle Contest: Body Strength Estimation

In this project, I developed a linear regression to estimate oneâ€™s grip force based on the body data, achieving a PR95 ranking in prediction accuracy among participants.

## Regression Model 
- Applies polynomial regression.  
- Normalizes features and target values using Min-Max scaling.  
- Uses Gradient Descent to optimize model parameters by minimizing Mean Squared Error.  

## Prediction
- Generates predictions on the validation dataset and evaluates performance using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
